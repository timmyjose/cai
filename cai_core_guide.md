### Prep Work

Practise the following till it becomes second nature.

  * Implement an ArrayList from scratch.
  
  * Reverse a Linked List.

  * Implement a Stack and Queue using array.

  * Implement a Hash Table using simple hashing functions.

  * Implement a Graph using Adjacency List, and implement BFS and DFS.

  * Implement Binary Search - recursive and iterative.

  * Implement the Merge Sort algorithm.

  * Implement the Quick Sort algorithm.

  * Implement Binary Tree traversals - BFS and DFS.

  * Memorise time and space complexities for common algorithms - https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/

  * Implement a Trie.

  * Master Bit manipulation tricks - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bit-tricks-competitive-programming/


### Strategy

  * Maintain progress in the cai_progress file.

  * Set a maximum of 25 minutes per problems - 5 minutes to understand the problem, and 20 minutes to solve it on paper.

  * Think deep and try to find the solution within the given timer. Do not look up the solution.

  * Once you hit 30-35 minutes in total on a problem, just stop immediately then and there.

  * Code the solution.

  * Revisit the question the following week.
